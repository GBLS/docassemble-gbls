  This YML file works with legal_server.py to help you make use of JSON data sent
  from Legal Server (using Jonathan Pyle's instruction block trick)
  
  It also defines three objects: client, advocate, and adverse_parties. If the 
  interview was not called from Legal Server, fallback questions are provided.
