  This YML file works with legal_server.py to help you make use of JSON data sent
  from Legal Server (using Jonathan Pyle's instruction block trick)
  
  It also defines three objects: client, advocate, and adverse_parties. If the 
  interview was not called from Legal Server, fallback questions are provided.

modules:
  - docassemble.base.util
  - .legal_server
---
objects:
  - client: Individual
  - advocate: Individual
  - adverse_parties: DAList.using(object_type=Person,auto_gather=False,gathered=True)
