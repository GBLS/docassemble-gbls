  This YML file works with legal_server.py to help you make use of JSON data sent
  from Legal Server (using Jonathan Pyle's instruction block trick)
  
  It also defines seven objects: client, advocate, household, adverse_parties, pbadvocate, income, and initiator. If the 
  interview was not called from Legal Server, fallback questions are provided.

  - docassemble.base.util
  - docassemble.gbls.legal_server

  - docassemble.income.income

  If this is not a separate objects block, it will create an error condition.
